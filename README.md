# tokoin-simple-test

## How to run?
1. To run process : run command line: go run main.go
2. To run unit test: go to floder testing, then run command line: go test + filename.go

## Explan what i do.
### Structure, design code:
* I apply structure this because it's quite easy to understand, clean and highly reuseable.
* We have floder datas to init data from file .json, and mock data to unit test. Floder repositories to find data from memory have use worker pool (it's make )
